# msld-py-prep

*msld-py-prep* scripts for creating a multiple topology model for Multisite 位-Dynamics (MS位D) in CHARMM. 

These scripts identify common atoms (similar partial atomic charge and identical atom types) across different compounds of interest with a maximum common substructure search. A charge renormalization algorithm is then implemented to generate a set of partial atomic charges suitable for multisite sampling of many chemical functional groups with MS位D. 

The output is a directory of CHARMM compatible files to use for MS位D simulations, including an example CHARMM input script. 


# Installation 
You can start using the scripts by cloning this repository and following the tutorial in the `examples` directory:

`git clone https://github.com/Vilseck-Lab/msld-py-prep.git`<br>
`cd msld-py-prep`

# Dependencies
msld_py_prep requires Python 3 (or later versions), numpy, and pandas (or alternatively Anaconda) <br>
Lg_Solvate.sh uses convpdb.pl from the MMTSB toolset (https://github.com/mmtsb/toolset) <br>
vis_check.py is written for use with PyMOL (https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source) <br>

# Usage
Please see the examples directory for a detailed tutorial.

# Citation
Citation pending, manuscript under review.
