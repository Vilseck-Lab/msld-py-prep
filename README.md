# msld-py-prep

*msld-py-prep* scripts for creating a multiple topology model for Multisite λ-Dynamics (MSλD) in CHARMM. 

These scripts match common atoms (similar partial charge and identical atom types) across different compounds of interest. A charge renormalization algorithm is implemented to generate a set of common atoms called a common core, as well as the corresponding fragments for each compound. 

The output is a directory of CHARMM compatible files to readily use for MSλD simulations, including the input scripts for such simulations.
